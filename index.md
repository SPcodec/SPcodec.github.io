This is a C# code I wrote to simulate the Event cards drawn in a board game called "Settlers of Catan.
There are 36 numbered cards and 1 New Year card in the deck.
The New Year card is always placed on top of 5 face down event cards. The remaining 31 event cards are placed on top of the New Year card.
At the beginning of a player's turn, they draw an Event card.
When the New Year card is drawn, all event cards are shuffled back into the deck with the New Year card on top of the 5 face down event cards and the game continues with the new deck.
